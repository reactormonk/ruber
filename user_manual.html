<h3>Basic usage</h3>
<p>By design, Ruber can be used to work on both stand-alone files (for example, a
small ruby script) or projects containing multiple files.</p>
<h4>Editing stand-alone files</h4>
<p>The basic operations to work with a single file are those common to most editors:
use the <code>File/New</code> menu entry to create a new file or the <code>File/Open</code> menu entry
to open an existing file and <code>File/Save</code> or <code>File/Save As</code> menu entries to save it.</p>
<p>Like other editors, Ruber allows you to change settings for a single file. To do
so, use the <code>Document/Configure Document</code> menu entry. Using this functionality
you can, for example, tell Ruber to always use a particular ruby interpreter to
execute that file, without changing the default global interpreter. Note that this
only works for ruby settings. For settings used by the editor component, you&#8217;ll
need to use modelines. See the <a href="http://docs.kde.org/development/en/kdesdk/kate/config-variables.html">Kate documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Note that some of the functionality provided by plugins only works for projects.
This is because stand-alone files are meant to truly be stand-alone. For example,
the rake plugin provides no functionality for single files, because usually a
Rakefile is used together with other files.</p>
<h4>Working with projects</h4>
<p>In Ruber, a project consists of a directory (called <em>project directory</em>_)
containing a file with extension
<code>.ruprj</code> and possibly one or two oteher files, one with extension <code>.ruusr</code> and one
with extension <code>.ruses</code>. The first file is called <em>project file</em>, the second is
called <em>user file</em> and the third <em>session file</em>.</p>
<p>The project files contains settings which are intrinsic to the project (for example,
the name of the project, which files belong to the project, or the patterns
associating each file with its spec file).</p>
<p>The user file, instead, contains settings which are specific for a user (for example,
the path of the ruby interpreter to use, which may vary on different systems,
or the shortcuts to associate to rake tasks, which each developers chooses
according to his own preferences).</p>
<p>The session file contains settings which are not only specific to a user, but also
to the current status of the environment. For example, the list of open files
in the project (used to restore them when Ruber is next started) is stored here.
Usually, settings in this file are created automatically and don&#8217;t appear in the
project configuration dialog.</p>
<p>Of these files, the project file is the only one which defines the identity of the
project and the only one which is meant to be shared among developers working
on the project; the other two files are optional and not meant to be shared. If
your project is under version control, you usually want to version control only
the project file (unless you&#8217;re working alone, in which case you may also want to
version control the user file).</p>
<p>To open an existing project, use the <code>Projects/Open Project</code> menu entry, or
the <code>Projects/Open Recent Project</code>.</p>
<p>To create a new project, use the <code>Projects/New Project</code> menu entry. You&#8217;ll be
shown a dialog where you must enter the project name and choose a location where
to create it (the default location is controlled by a global setting). Pressing
the OK button will create a directory named as the project in the location you
chose and containing a project, user file and sessions file having the same name
as the directory.</p>
<p>After creating a new project, one of the first things to do is setup the list
of files which Ruber should consider as belonging to the project.</p>
<p>To decide whether or not a file belongs to the project, Ruber uses <em>include rules</em>
and <em>exclude rules</em>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a file belongs to the project if it matches at least one include rule and no
  exclude rule;</li>
	<li>a file doesn&#8217;t belong to the project if it matches at least an exclude rule or
  if it doesn&#8217;t match any rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three kinds of rules:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>file rules</dt>
	<dd>strings which specify a single file in the project directory.
  They only match that file</dd>
	<dt>regexp rules</dt>
	<dd>regexps to match files in the project directory. The names of
  the files will be relative to the project directory (without any leading <code>./</code>).</dd>
	<dt>shell glob rules</dt>
	<dd>shell globs which match files in the project directory.</dd>
</dl>
<p>File rules and regexp rules can be used to specify either include or exclude rules,
while shell glob rules can only be used for include rules.</p>
<p>To create the list of files belonging to the project, use
the <code>Project/Configure Project</code> menu entry and go to the General page of the
dialog. It&#8217;s aspect will be similar to the following.</p>
<p><a href="images/project_files_dialog.png">
  <img src="images/project_files_dialog.png" style="width:95%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" alt="General page of the Project Settings dialog"/>
</a></p>
<p>Write the shell glob rules in the <code>Extensions</code> line edit, separate by either spaces
or commas, or both (note that you can&#8217;t have spaces in the globs). This is usually
done so that files with certain extensions belong to the project without having
to add them explicitly.</p>
<p>To add a file or regexp include rule, use the corresponding buttons in the <code>Files
to include</code> box, while to add file and regexp exclude rules use the buttons in
the <code>Files to exclude</code> box. To remove a rule, select it and click on the <code>Remove
rule</code> button in the appropriate section. Note that you can only add a file rule
for an existing file.</p>
<p>In the project configuration dialog, you can also set various project-wide options
provided by the plugins you have loaded. You can&#8217;t change the project name, however
(if you really want to, you can do so opening the project file in any editor (after
making sure the project is not open in Ruber), and look for an entry called <code>project_name</code> under a <code>general</code> entry.
The value after the colon is the name of the project. Change it and close the file.</p>
<p>Currently, in Ruber you can only have one open project at a time. Opening a project
(or creating a new one) will close the current project (if any).</p>
<h3>Ruber user interface</h3>
<p>Ruber&#8217;s UI comprises:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>an editor</dt>
	<dd>located in the centre of the Ruber window, this is where you
  edit the current file.</dd>
	<dt>a tab bar</dt>
	<dd>placed above the editor, it has a tab for each open file. Clicking
  on a tab you activate the corresponding file, making it visible in the editor</dd>
	<dt>three tool widget bars</dt>
	<dd>located left, right and below the editor, they contain
  a button for each tool widget. Clicking on the button makes the corresponding
  tool widget become visible.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Tool widgets</h4>
<p>When a tool widget has focus, you can press F2 to switch back to the editor
(without closing the tool widget). Pressing Shift+F2, instead, moves the focus
to the editor and close the tool widget. Pressing Shift+F2 when the focus is in
the editor, instead, will reopen (and give focus to) the last closed tool widget.</p>
<p>All the tool widget displaying the output from external programs share some
functionality. In particular:</p>
<ul>
	<li>left clicking on a line containing a file name hides the tool widget and opens the
  file in the editor. If the line also contained a line number associated with
  the file (with the syntax <code>file_name:line_number</code>, then the cursor will be moved
  to that line</li>
	<li>left clicking on a line containing a file name while keeping the Meta keyboard button
  pressed will cause the same effect but won&#8217;t close the tool widget</li>
	<li>left clicking on several lines while keeping the Ctrl or the Shift keyboard
  buttons pressed will select multiple lines according to the usual conventions</li>
	<li>right clicking on the tool widget will display a context menu. In the menu
  you&#8217;ll find several entries, among which: Clear, which empties the tool widget,
  Copy and Copy Selection which copy respectively the whole content of the tool
  widget or the selected lines in the clipboard. Note that some tool widgets
  may organize the output in complex way, maybe using a tree (for an example,
  see the RSpec plugin) and may implement copying to clipboard in an unexpected
  way (or not implement it at all)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some tool widgets also provide a filtering functionality. To use it, choose the
&#8220;Create Filter&#8221; entry from the context menu, enter the desired regular expression
in the line edit which becomes visible and (with focus in the line edit) press
Enter. Now only the lines matching the regexp you entered will be visible. You
can remove the filter using the Clear Filter context menu entry. If you want to
remove the filter but be able to apply it without writing it again, check the 
Ignore Filter entry. Uncheking it will make the filter active again.</p>
<h4>The Quick Open File dialog</h4>
<p>When you have a project open, you can quickly open a file belonging to the project
by using the Quick Open File menu entry in the Project menu. It&#8217;l display a dialog
with a list of all files in the project and a line edit above it. In the line edit,
you can enter a regular exrpession to restrict the list of files. If the regexp
contains the path separator (<code>/</code>), the regexp will match both the file name and
the directory name (relative to the project directory). If the regexp doesn&#8217;t
contain a path separator, only the file name will be matched.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the list of files is:</p>
<pre><code>lib/plugins.rb
plugins/x.rb
plugins/y.rb</code></pre>
<p>If the regexp is <code>plug</code>, then the list will only contain <code>plugins.rb</code>. If the regexp
is <code>plugins/</code>, then all three files will be listed.</p>
<p>Pressing the up and down keys on your keyboard will navigate the list of files
even if the focus is in the line edit.</p>
<h3>Configuring Ruber</h3>
<h4>Choosing the plugins</h4>
<p>You can choose the plugins using the <code>Settings/Choose Plugins</code> menu entry. It&#8217;ll
display a dialog like the one in the following picture
<a href="images/choose_plugins_dialog.png">
  <img src="images/choose_plugins_dialog.png" style="width:95%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" alt="General page of the Project Settings dialog"/>
</a></p>
<p>The list at the top of the widget contains all the plugins availlable on your system,
together with a description (second column) and their plugin directory (third column).</p>
<p>Checked plugins are the ones you have enabled (or which are enabled in the default
Ruber configuration, if you didn&#8217;t change it).</p>
<p>Plugins which are partially checked (like Ruby runner and Autosave in the picture)
are plugins which you didn&#8217;t choose, but are needed because some of the plugins
you&#8217;ve enabled need them. You can click again on them to choose them, but can&#8217;t
disable them.</p>
<p>The lower part of the dialog contains a list of directories which are searched
for plugins. By default, the <code>plugins</code> subdirectory Ruber installation directory
and a directory in your <span class="caps">KDE</span> configuration directory. You can add other directories
by inserting it in the <span class="caps">URL</span> widget above the list, then pressing the Add button.
To remove a directory, select it, then press the Remove button. You can move the
selected directory up and down with the corresponding buttons. Plugins in directories
higher in the list have priority over those in directories below them.</p>
<p>If changing the plugin directories causes problems, such as some selected plugins
being missing, or some dependencies among plugins being unsatisfied, you&#8217;ll be
warned with a message box.</p>
<h4>Configuring the editor component</h4>
<p>To configure the editor, use the <code>Settings/Configure Editor</code> menu entry. The dialog
is the same as the <code>Editor component</code> page in the Kate Settings dialog.</p>
<h4>Configuring Ruber</h4>
<p>To change options related to Ruber, use the <code>Settings/Configure Ruber</code> menu entry.</p>
<p>The Ruber core provides two pages in this dialog, General and Colors (the other
pages you may see are associated with plugins and will be described in each
plugin&#8217;s section).</p>
<p>In the General page, you can configure:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The font to be used in all the tool widgets which display output from command
  line programs, such as ruby or rspec. You&#8217;re advised (but not forced) to
  choose a fixed-with font like Courier or Monospace.</li>
	<li>Wether or no to apply word wrapping to tool widgets displaying output from
  command line programs. Note that some plugins may force or forbid word-wrapping:
  this option won&#8217;t affect them</li>
	<li>The default path for scripts (stand-alone files). This is the path where the
  Open and Save As dialog will start if no project is open (if a project is open,
  the dialog will always start in the project&#8217;s directory).</li>
	<li>The default path for project. This is the path where the Open Project will
  start in and the path used as location by the New Project dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Colors page, you can configure the colors commonly used by various tool
widgets, in particular those displaying output from external programs.</p>
<p>Each line of text in these tool widget is of one of four categories:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>output</dt>
	<dd>text displayed by the external program on standard output</dd>
	<dt>errors</dt>
	<dd>text displayed by the external program on standard error and referring to
errors (for example, uncaught exceptions raised by ruby)</dd>
	<dt>warnings</dt>
	<dd>text displayed by the external program on standard error and containing
warnings (for example those messages output by ruby when called with the <code>-w</code> flag)</dd>
	<dt>message</dt>
	<dd>text which doesn&#8217;t belong to any of the other categories. Usually, this
is text produced by Ruber itself (either the core or, more often, the plugin the
tool widget belongs to).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Beside each of the Output, Error and Warning label there are three color selectors,
labeled &#8220;Default&#8221;, &#8220;Variant 1&#8221; and &#8220;Variant 2&#8221;. Variants can be used by plugins
to display text belonging to the same category but with somewhat different meaning
in different colors (for example, a plugin which runs two programs in sequence
can use the default color to display the output of the first one and the &#8220;variant 1&#8221;
color for the output of the second).</p>
<p>Also beside the Message label there are color selectors, labeled with &#8220;Default&#8221;,
&#8220;Good&#8221; and &#8220;Bad&#8221;. The meaning is similar to those of the variants: the color
associated with &#8220;Good&#8221; is used to display messages which the user will consider
good (for example, the success of a given operation). Conversely, the color associated
with &#8220;Bad&#8221; is used to inform of bad news (for example, that something has failed),
while the &#8220;Default&#8221; color is used for messages which are neither good nor bad.</p>
<h2>Plugins</h2>
<h3>Autosave</h3>
<p>The autosave plugin is used by other plugins to automatically save some files
(which files depends on the plugin) before running certain actions, according to
the settings chosen by the user (for example, the Ruby development plugin saves
all project files before running the script associated with the project). As user,
you don&#8217;t interact with the plugin, except to choose how it should behave.</p>
<p>In the Genral page of the Ruber configuration dialog there&#8217;s a section for the
Autosave plugin. It contains a check box, which allows you to turn autosaving on
or off for all plugin, and a checkable list of plugins under the Exceptions label.
When autsaving is globally enabled, you can disable it for a plugin by unchecking
the corresponding item from the list. Note that, if autosave is disabled globally,
there&#8217;s no way to enable it only for some plugins. You need to enable it globally
and manually disable it for the plugins you don&#8217;t want.</p>
<h3>Command</h3>
<p>The Command plugin allows you to directly interact with Ruber internals. It provides
a tool widget containing a text editor and an Execute button. Any ruby code written
in the text editor is executed in the Ruber environment (in the context of the
toplevel object) by using <code>eval</code>. All exceptions produced by your code are caught
and displayed in a message box, so Ruber won&#8217;t crash even if your code here is
incorrect.</p>
<p>This plugin gives you access to all of Ruber power, just as if you were writing a
new plugin.</p>
<h3>Find in files</h3>
<p>The Find in files plugin is a frontend for <a href="http://rak.rubyforge.org">rak</a>, which,
according to the author, is <i>a grep replacement in pure Ruby</i> which 
<i>accepts Ruby syntax regular expressions and automatically recurses directories</i>.</p>
<p>To use this plugin, choose the <code>Find and Replace in Files</code> entry from the Edit menu.
This displays a dialog similar to the one in the following picture.
<a href="images/find_in_files_dialog.png">
  <img src="images/find_in_files_dialog.png" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" alt="Find in files dialog"/>
</a></p>
<p>In the Find line edit, enter the text you want to find. It will be interpreted
as a regular expression or as plain text according to the value set in the Mode
combo box. If you want to replace the found occcurrences of the text with something
else, insert the replacement string in the Replace with line edit. You can use
back references here (<code>\1</code>, <code>\2</code> and so on).</p>
<p>Under the Options caption, you find widgets to control how the search is performed:
besides changing the mode as described above, you can decide whether the search
should be case sensitive and whether only whole words should match.</p>
<p>The entries under the Filter label can be used to restrict the files to search.
Checking the All Files radio button will cause the search to be carried out in
all files; checking the File type button, and then one or more of the entries in
the combo box next to it will cause the search to be performed only on files of the
selected kind. Finally, the Custom filter line edit can be used to enter a regexp
(not a shell glob) to add another filter in addition to the one provided by the
file type.</p>
<p>Under the Path entry there are the widgets to choose the set of files to search.
In the Search in combo box there are two or four entries (depending on whether or not
you have an open project):</p>
<dl>
	<dt>open files</dt>
	<dd>the search will be done among all files corresponding to documents
  opened in the editor (editor tabs with documents not corresponding to open files
  will be ignored)</dd>
	<dt>custom directory</dt>
	<dd>choosing this entry will enable the Directory <span class="caps">URL</span> widget next
  to the combo box: the search will be done in all the files in the directory chosen
  here</dd>
	<dt>project files</dt>
	<dd>the search will be performed on all files belonging to the current
  project</dd>
	<dt>project directory</dt>
	<dd>the search will be performed on all files in the current
  project&#8217;s directory</dd>
</dl>
<p>Obviously the last two entries will only be present if there&#8217;s an open project.</p>
<p>The list of files to search is restricted according to the filters defined in
the Filters section.</p>
<p>Once you filled the dialog according to your needs, press the Find or the Replace
button depending on what you want to do (note that the Replace button becomes the
default if the Replace with line edit contains some text).</p>
<h4>Finding text</h4>
<p>In response to the Find button, the dialog will be closed and the Find in Files
tool widget becomes visible. It contains a tree with the names of the file wehere
the text was found, having as children the list of matches. The numbers left to
the matches are the corresponding line numbers.</p>
<h4>Replacing text</h4>
<p>If you clicked the Replace button, instead, the Replace in Files tool widget will
be shown. It contains a tree somewhat similar to the one described above, with
some important differences. Each match has two columns, labelled
&#8220;Original text&#8221; and &#8220;Replacement text&#8221; as the names imply, the first contains the
text found in the file; the second shows the text as it would be modified. To the
left of each entry (both those with the file name and those with the match)
there&#8217;s a check box. Unchecking the box will exclude that entry from the replacement.
Note that unchecking a file entry will exclude all the matches in that file from
replacement.</p>
<p>After having inspected the results produced by the match and chosen which replacements
you actually want to carry out, you can press the Replace button in the tool widget
to perform the changes. Note that, if the contents of a file change between the
time it was searched and the time you click this button, the corresponding entries
in the tool widget will become disabled, and you won&#8217;t be able to do the replacements
in it.</p>
<p>If you decide that you don&#8217;t want to perform this replacement, you can use the
Clear button in the tool widget to empty it. This isn&#8217;t actually needed, but it
can avoid to press the Replace button by mistake.</p>
<p>If any files on which the replacement was carried is modified in the editor, the
plugin will attempt to save it (using the autosave plugin). If you chose not to
save them, they won&#8217;t be included in the replacement.</p>
<p>The plugin takes care of updating files open in the editor in which replacements
have been performed.</p>
<h3>Project browser</h3>
<p>This plugin provides a tool widget which lists the files in the project directory
in a tree. You can choose whether to display only the files belonging to the project
or all the files in the directory by right-clicking in the tool widget and checking
or unchecking the Show Only Project Files entry.</p>
<p>Left-clicking on a file will close the tool widget and display the file in the
editor; doing so while pressing the Meta key will live the tool widget open.</p>
<p>If no project is open, will disable the tree view.</p>
<h3>Rake</h3>
<p>This plugin allows to run rake tasks for the current project from within Ruber.
It provides the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Run rake task for the current project from a dialog or menu</li>
	<li>Associate shortcuts to rake task for current project</li>
	<li>Associate shortcuts to rake task globally (quick tasks)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Rake page in the Ruber configuration dialog, you can choose the rake
program to use and whether standard output from rake should be synchronized or
not (this is implemented passing <code>-E '$stdout.sync=true'</code> to rake). You can also
setup quick tasks there (see <a href="#rake-quick-tasks">below</a>).</p>
<p>In the Rake page in the project configuration dialog, you can set several options
related to rake for the project itself:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the options to give to ruby when running rake</li>
	<li>the rake program to use (override the option set globally)</li>
	<li>the rakefile to use for the project. If left empty, rake will be left free to
  find out the rakefile by itself (from the project directory)</li>
	<li>the environment variables to pass to rake. It must be a list of strings of the
  form <code>VAR1=value1 VAR2=value2 VAR3="value 3" VAR4='value 4'</code>. If you need space
  in values, you need to quote the value. Note that the parsing of such strings
  may fail in unusual cases</li>
	<li>the maximum time allowed to rake to retrieve the list of tasks from a rakefile.
  In several circumstances, this plugin needs to find out from rake which tasks
  are defined in the rakefile. If the rakefile is improperly written this can freeze
  Ruber (for example, in case of an endless loop). To avoid this, the Rake plugin
  gives rake a maximum time to obtain the list of tasks. If you know that the
  rakefile for a given project needs more time than the default allowed to generate
  the list of tasks, you can increase the time</li>
	<li>whether standard output from rake should be synchronized or not. This overrides
  the global setting</li>
	<li>configure the tasks for the project (see <a href="#rake-project-tasks">below</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rake-tasks-for-current-project">Run rake tasks for current project</h4>
<p>To run tasks for the current project, you can use either the <code>Ruby/Rake/Run Rake Task</code>
or the <code>Ruby/Rake/Project Tasks</code> menu entries. The former will display a dialog
with a list of tasks defined in the rakefile associated with the project; the
second displays a submenu with the same tasks.</p>
<p>Since retrieving tasks from rake takes some time, this list is not update every
time the menu or the dialog are displayed (in particular, the first time you display
the dialog or the menu, the list may be empty). To update the list, you need to press
the Refresh Tasks button in the dialog or choose the Refresh Tasks entry from the
submenu.</p>
<p>To run a task from the dialog, select it from the list, then click the Ok button.
You can use the line edit above the list to search for a task in the list.</p>
<p>To run a task from the submenu, simply choose the correspoding entry.</p>
<p>Note that you can&#8217;t run the default task from either the menu or the dialog. To
do so, use the <code>Ruby/Rake/Run Default Task</code> menu entry.</p>
<h4 id="rake-project-tasks">Associate shortcuts to tasks for project</h4>
<p>You can associate a keyboard shortcut to tasks in the current project. To do so,
open the project configuration dialog and go to the Rake page. Under the Tasks
caption, you&#8217;ll find a list of tasks defined in the rakefile. As described
<a href="#rake-tasks-for-current-project">above</a>, the list of tasks may not be up-to-date.
Use the Refresh task button below to update it. Double-clicking on the Shortcut
column of the list will bring up a shortcut editor, where you can choose the shortcut
for the corresponding task. You can also add or remove tasks manually by using the
Add Tasks and Remove Tasks button.</p>
<h4 id="rake-quick-tasks">Quick tasks</h4>
<p>Quick tasks are task which you configure globally and are availlable for all projects.
They&#8217;re meant to be used for tasks you have in each project, so that you don&#8217;t have
to configure them each time (for example, almost of my projects have a <code>doc</code> task.
Defining a quick task with that name and assigning a shortcut to it, I can execute
the task with a single key press for any project).</p>
<p>You can execute quick tasks either by using the associated keyboard shortcut or
using the <code>Ruby/Rake/Quick Tasks</code> submenu.</p>
<p>You manage quick tasks from the Rake page of the Ruber configuration dialog. You
can add tasks using the Add Task dialog and remove them using the Remove Task dialog.
Double clicking on the task name or shortcut, you can edit them.</p>
<h3>RSpec</h3>
<p>The RSpec plugin allows to run rspec examples from within Ruber. It will only work
from within a project.</p>
<p>This plugin should work with both RSpec 1 and RSpec 2 (although the former is more
tested). It will use RSpec 2 if <code>`which rspec`</code> returns finds something and RSpec
1 otherwise.</p>
<p>The <code>Ruby/Tests</code> menu contains entries to run RSpec for the current project, the
current file or the current line.</p>
<p>To run the spec in the current line, open the spec file, move the cursor to the
line of the example you want to run, then use the <code>Ruby/Tests/Run Current Spec</code>
menu entry.</p>
<p>To run the all tests in the current project, you first need to configure the project.
From the project configuration dialog, go to the RSpec page and choose the directory
where the spec files are (Spec Directory) and the shell glob matching spec files.
Then, use the <code>Ruby/Tests/Run Project Specs</code> menu entry to run all the files
contained in the spec directory and matching the chosen glob.</p>
<p>Running the spec associated with the current file works differently according to
whether the current file is a spec file (that is, it&#8217;s in the spec directory and
matches the spec filter as chosen in the project configuration dialog) or not. In
the first case, all the spec in the current file are executed. In the second case,
the plugin looks for a spec associated with it and runs it. By default this means looking in
the spec directory for a file called as the current file but with a <code>_spec</code> inserted
before the <code>.rb</code> extension. You can configure how to associate a file with the
corresponding spec in the RSpec page of the project configuration dialog by changing
the contents of the Pattern line edit (use %f to indicate the base name of the
file).</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re working on a file, you can quickly switch to the corresponding spec
file by using the <code>Ruby/Tests/Switch to Spec</code> menu entry. When you&#8217;re working on
a spec, you can switch to the corresponding code file by using the <code>Ruby/Tests/Switch to Spec</code>
menu entry. Both entries associate code files and spec files as described above.</p>
<p>From the RSpec page of the project configuration dialog, you can change several
other parameters: the options to pass ruby when running rspec, the path of the
RSpec executable to use, options to be passed to RSpec and whether to instruct
RSpec to generate full backtraces (which is the same as passing the <code>-b</code> option
to RSpec).</p>
<h3>Ruby Development</h3>
<p>The Ruby Development plugin allows you to run the program associated to your project,
the file corresponding to the current document or any other file from within
Ruber and to display the output in a tool widget.</p>
<p>The <code>Ruby/Run Current File</code> menu entry will run the file associated to the current document
in ruby, while the <code>Ruby/Run Current File</code> will show a dialog where you can choose
the file to run.</p>
<p>The <code>Ruby/Run</code> menu entry will work as <code>Run Current File</code> if there&#8217;s no open project
and there&#8217;s an open ruby file and as <code>Run File</code> if there is neither an open project
nor an open file. If there&#8217;s an open project, instead, it will run the script
associated with the project. By default, it&#8217;s a file with the same name as the
project and located in the <code>bin</code> subdirectory of the project directory. You can
change it In the ruby page of the project configuration dialog by entering another
file name in the Path line edit.</p>
<p>This plugin also allows to run scripts in a terminal, rather than in Ruber. This
is mostly useful for scripts which read from standard input, as it (currently)
can&#8217;t be done from within Ruber. You can enable this by checking the
<code>Ruby/Run Programs in Terminal</code> menu entry or through the project or document
configuration dialog. Note that, for the time being, this needs the <code>konsole</code>
program (part of <code>kdebase-applications</code>) to work.</p>
<p>There are several global settings for this plugin, which you can change in the
Ruby page of the Ruber configuration dialog. They are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the list of availlable ruby interpreters. By default this plugin looks for programs
  called <code>ruby</code>, <code>ruby19</code>, <code>ruby18</code>, <code>ruby1.9</code> and <code>ruby1.8</code> in your <span class="caps">PATH</span> (using
  the <code>which</code> program). To add other interpreters, remove the ones you don&#8217;t want
  to see listed or change the order, use the Availlable interpreters widget</li>
	<li>the default ruby interpreter to use. Among the interpreters listed in the
  Availlable Interpreters widget, you can choose which one to use by default by
  setting it in the Default Interpreter widget</li>
	<li>the default options to pass to ruby. Set them in the Ruby options widget</li>
</ul>
<p>Some parameters used by this plugin can also be configured on a per project base
from the Ruby page of the project configuration dialog. They are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the path of the project script (as described above)</li>
	<li>the options to pass to the project script</li>
	<li>the working directory of the project script (which defaults to the project directory)</li>
	<li>whether the project script should be run from a terminal or not</li>
	<li>the ruby interpreter to use (overrides the global setting)</li>
	<li>the options to pass to the ruby interpreter (overrides the global setting)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the above options can also be set on a per document base (except, of course,
for the project script and the working directory).</p>
<p>The ruby interpreter to use can also be changed temporarily by selecting another
interpreter from the <code>Ruby/Ruby Interpreter</code> menu. This overrides both the global
setting and the setting for the current document or project.</p>
<h3>State</h3>
<p>The State plugin allows to save the state of Ruber, of each project and each document
between sessions, so that it can be restored when Ruber, the project, or the file
is next reopened.</p>
<p>By <i>state</i>, this plugin mean:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>for Ruber</dt>
	<dd>the list of open projects and files not belonging to any project</dd>
	<dt>for a project</dt>
	<dd>the list of files belonging to the project</dd>
	<dt>for a file</dt>
	<dd>the cursor position in the file.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As a user, you don&#8217;t interact with this plugin, except to configure its behaviour
in the Ruber configuration dialog. The options you can change are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>when opening a document, whether to move the cursor to the position it was when
  the document was last closed</li>
	<li>when opening a project, whether to open the files which were opened when the project
  was last closed</li>
	<li>what to do when Ruber starts up. You can decide to:
	<ul>
		<li>Restore all the open projects and documents</li>
		<li>Open all the projects which were open last time, but don&#8217;t open any file</li>
		<li>Open all the files which were open last time, but don&#8217;t open any project</li>
		<li>Restore nothing (this will start Ruber with no open project and a single, empty
   document</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Syntax Checker</h3>
<p>The sytnax checker plugin allows to check the syntax of a ruby or <span class="caps">YAML</span> file.</p>
<p>The syntax check is done every time the file is saved and after a pause of at least
1 second while editing the document (that is, if you don&#8217;t change the text for at
least one second). You can disable this automatic checking from the Ruber configuration
dialog in the Syntax page.</p>
<p>The plugin only works for documents associated with a file (it&#8217;s not smart enough
to find out whether the contents of the document are ruby or <span class="caps">YAML</span> code and needs
to relay on the extension of the file).</p>
<p>The plugin shows the result of the last syntax check in a <span class="caps">LED</span> widget at the right
end of the status bar: if it&#8217;s green, then there aren&#8217;t syntax errors; if it&#8217;s red,
there are syntax errors. Finally, if it&#8217;s gray it means that no syntax check has
been done, either because the document isn&#8217;t associated with a <span class="caps">YAML</span> or ruby file
or because the conditions for the check haven&#8217;t already happened.</p>
<p>In case of syntax errors, hovering with the mouse over the <span class="caps">LED</span> will display a tool
tip with the error message of the first error; left-clicking on the <span class="caps">LED</span> will move
the cursor to the corresponding line. Right-clicking on the <span class="caps">LED</span> will display a
menu listing all the errors: clicking on an item in the menu moves the cursor to
the position of the corresponding error.</p>
<p>The syntax check for ruby files is done using <code>ruby -c</code>, while the <span class="caps">YAML</span> syntax
chek is done passing the contents of the file to <code>YAML.load</code> and seeing whether
it raises exceptions.</p>
<p>In the case of ruby files, you can choose the interpreter to use for the syntax
check as explained in the description of the Ruby Developer plugin.</p>
