h1. Installation instructions

h2. Dependencies

To run Ruber, you need to have the following installed
* Ruby 1.8.7 MRI or later 
* Korundum (KDE Ruby bindings) version 4.5.0 or greater. The 4.4 releases
  may or may not work (some bugs have been fixed since these versions, so earlier
  versions may lead to crashes).
* The Facets gem ("http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/":http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/),
  version 2.7 or later
* The Dictionary gem ("http://death.rubyforge.org/dictionary/":http://death.rubyforge.org/dictionary/)

h2. Plugin dependencies

Some plugins need external libraries and/or programs to work. If you don't have
these requirements, then some of the plugins won't work. Ruber itself and the
other plugins will still work correctly, however. The programs needed by the plugins
are:

* rak ("http://rak.rubyforge.org/":http://rak.rubyforge.org/), needed by the Find in Files plugin
* rake ("http://rake.rubyforge.org/":http://rake.rubyforge.org/), needed by the Rake plugin (already included in ruby 1.9.x)
* rspec ("RSpec 1":http://rspec.info/, "RSpec 2":http://github.com/rspec/rspec/wiki), needed by the RSpec plugin

h2. Installing Ruber and its dependencies

h3. The easy way

The easiest way to install Ruber is to use the packages provided by your distribution
and rubygems to install any gem your distribution doesn't package:
* Install Ruby using your package manager
* Install the KDE Ruby bindings using your package manager (usually, the name of the package
  will be something like @korundum@, @korundum4@ or @kdebindings-ruby@). Depending
  on the packages you have already installed on your system, this other packages
  may also be installed.
* Install Facets and Dictionary using your package manager or rubygems there are
  no packages for them:
  
bc. gem install facets
gem install dictionary

* Install Ruber:

bc. gem install ruber

h3. The hard way

The hard way to install ruber is to install the needed dependencies by hand. In particular
(depending on what you have already installed) this may mean installing ruby, the KDE
libraries and the KDE Ruby bindings. If you want, you can also mix the easy and
the hard way, installing some of the above programs using your package manager and
some other by hand.

h4. Installing Ruby by hand

* Download ruby from "the Ruby home page":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
* Unpack the tarball
* @cd@ in the directory created by unpacking the tarball
* Run @./configure@, passing it any argument you want. In particular, you may want
  to change the installation directory (which by default is @/usr/local@) and
  add a prefix or suffix to the executable name (this is useful if you want two)
  versions of ruby installed at the same time. To change the installation directory,
  pass the @--prefix DIR@ argument to configure, where @DIR@ is the directory you
  want to install ruby into. To add a prefix or a suffix to the executables, use
  the @--program-prefix@ or @--program-suffix@ options, followed by the prefix or
  suffix you want. Use @./configure --help@ to see all the options accepted by
  @configure@
* Run @make@
* Run @make install@. Unless you changed the installation directory to a directory
  you have write access to, this command must be run as superuser.
  
h4. Installing the KDE libraries by hand

I strongly discourage from building the KDE libraries by hand, given the large
number of dependencies they have and the fact that every distribution has packages
for them. To install using a package manager, simply install the @kdelibs@ package.

If you really want to install by hand, here's what to do
* Install the needed dependencies. They're listed on the "KDE techbase site":http://techbase.kde.org/Build_requirements,
  with instructions for different distributions. However, not all the dependencies
  listed here are required to install Ruber. You can try skipping this section for
  now and return to it after running cmake (see below).
* Download the KDE libraries from the "KDE home page":http://www.kde.org/download.
  Choose the version marked as _recommended for end users_, then, following the
  link, download the @kdelibs@ tarball. Do not follow the instructions linked on
  the download page, as they're for people developing KDE itself
* Unpack the tarball
* @cd@ in the directory created unpacking the tarball
* Create a build directory: @mkdir build@
* @cd build@
* @cmake ..@ This will fail if you're missing a required library. In this case,
  it'll tell you which it is and you'll be able to install it
* Run @ccmake .@ This will give you a pseudo-graphical interface where to set
  some options. In particular, look at the @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@ option, which controls
  the directory KDE will be installed into, and change it as you like. After changing
  the options you need, press @c@ to configure and @g@ to generate. Then @e@ to
  exit
* @make@
* @make install@. Unless you changed the installation directory to a directory
  you have write access to, this command must be run as superuser.
  
h4. Installation of the KDE Ruby bindings

* Make sure you have both the Ruby and KDE headers installed. If you installed 
  Ruby or the KDE libraries using the package manager, depending on your distribution, 
  you may not have installed the header files needed by the compiler. Using your
  package manager, see if there are packages called something like @ruby-devel@
  and @kdelibs-devel@ (or @ruby-headers@ and @kdelibs-headers@). If so, install
  them. If you installed Ruby and the KDE libraries by hand, the header files are
  already installed
* Download the @kdebindings@ tarball from the "KDE home page":http://www.kde.org/download.
  Choose the same version as your KDE libraries.
* Unpack the tarball.
* @cd@ in the directory created unpacking the tarball
* Create a build directory: @mkdir build@
* @cd build@
* @cmake ..@
* If you had a KDE environment installed before deciding to install Ruber, check,
  using your package manager, whether you also have a package called @smoke@ installed
* run @cmake ..@ This will give you a pseudo-graphical interface where to set
  some options. In particular, you may want to change the installation directory
  by setting the @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@ option. Most likely, you'll also want to
  avoid building the bindings for languages other than Ruby, so set the corresponding @BUILD_*@
  options (for example, @BUILD_perl@) to @OFF@. If you already have @smoke@ installed,
  also set @BUILD_smoke@ to @OFF@. After changing
  the options you need, press @c@ to configure and @g@ to generate. Then @e@ to
  exit
* @make@
* @make install@. Unless you changed the installation directory to a directory
  you have write access to, this command must be run as superuser.

h2. Installing plugin dependencies

* @rake@: @gem install rake@ (you don't need this if using ruby 1.9, unless you want
  to install a newer version of rake)
* @rspec@: @gem install rspec@
* @rak@: @gem install rak@
