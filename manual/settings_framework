h1. The Ruber Settings Framework

h2(#backends). The backend

The backend is the responsible for writing the options to file and reading them
from there. It should provide the following methods:
A constructor:: it should read all the contents of the file and store it. The file
                shouldn't be read anymore from that point, unless explicitly
                requested.
<tt>[opt]</tt>:: returns the value of the option _opt_. See add_option for an
                 explaination of what _opt_ is. Additional methods provided by
                 _opt_ may be used to determine its value. If no value for _opt_
                 is included in the file, the default value should be returned.
                 Note that, while the backend is free to store the values for the
                 different options however it wants, it _must_ make sure that
                 options with the same names, but belonging to different groups
                 don't clash.
<tt>write(data)</tt>:: writes the options back to file. _data_ is an hash whose
                       keys are the objects describing the options (see add_option)
                       and whose values are the actual values of the options.
