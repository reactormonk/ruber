h1. Ruber architecture

Ruber is a plugin-based IDE. This means that the Ruber program itself only provides
the core functionality: a system to load, unload, manage and access plugins, the
main window, the document/editor and project system. Everything else is provided
by plugins.

By itself, the Ruber program does only the following
* create some unique objects (such as the appplication and the main window) when
the application starts. Objects of this kind are treated almost like plugins,
only they are created before any other plugin is loaded and are hardcoded: the user
can't (as yet) write a plugin which provides a different main window or application.
These objects (of which only one is created during the application lifetime) are
called *core components*
* provide some frameworks for doing common operation (for example managing options,
GUI states and similar), some of which take the place of those provided by KDE
* provide a library of classes, such as the @Document@, @Project@ and @Plugin@
classes which represent fundamental Ruber entities
